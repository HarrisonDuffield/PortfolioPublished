Back Button 


Grid for chrome (IE should be fine but needs checking,) - FF works fine obvs

Maybe a startup animation

CSS rules for the Buttons


Method to embed the github repostiory / acitivty logs / lagnuage thing, maybe?



the picutre becomes the header when scrolled small


have the cards on the card page bigger, certainly on mobile , but less so 


deepl translation of pages, click button to reuturn back to english - translation defaults to local area lagnuage , based off ip/location



scroll down , header moves into centre of bar , back button shows


animated github tiles - like the windows start menu but done myself, automatic on mobile


github page calls api ,has stuff like total commits - follower count , as a slide that it revolves through - on PC only - on mobile it will just be a link to the profile



Instead of a sticky header - how about the header only reappears when on scroll. Maybe both, so its only like that on Mobile, where as upon PC it stays fixed
